## 🌟 Why DashDraw?

Most diagramming tools are bloated with enterprise features you don't need. DashDraw focuses on clarity and privacy.

* **🔒 100% Private:** Your diagrams are saved to your device. No data is ever sent to our servers.
* **⚡ Blazing Fast:** Runs entirely in your browser. Works offline once loaded.
* **✏️ SVG Native:** Your saved files are editable images. Drag them back onto the canvas to keep working.
* **🛠️ Zero Learning Curve:** Pre-configured for simplicity.

## 🚀 How to Use

1.  **Open the App:** Click the launch link above.
2.  **Draw:** Drag shapes from the sidebar onto the canvas.
3.  **Save:** Click `File > Save` to download an editable `.svg` file to your computer.
4.  **Edit Later:** Drag that `.svg` file back onto the blank canvas to resume editing.
